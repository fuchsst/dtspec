# Factories will represent a collection of test data.
# Scenarios are a colletion of test cases that concern some shared topic.
#   - The code being tested is expected to run only 1 time for a scenario.
#   - One run could be associated with multiple scenarios, up to user to decide
# Cases will contain assertions about the results of a run
#  - they can also contain additional conditions about data defined in a scenario
