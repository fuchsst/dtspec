  Realistic - A more realistic example of a test spec that highlights most of the features of dtspec.
  Includes multiple, sources, targets, scenarios, factories, and slightly more
  complex transformations.

  In this example, we have 4 source tables (raw_students, raw_schools,
  raw_classes, and dim_date), which get combined and aggregated into
  two target tables (student_classes and students_per_school).




identifiers:
  - identifier: students
    attributes:
      # The id attribute corresponds to a backend auto-generated number.
      # It has not meaning to business users and would not show up in any reports.
      - field: id
        generator: unique_integer
      # The external_id attribute is like the id printed on a student id card and has some
      # real world meaning.  It's string-like.
      - field: external_id
        generator: unique_string

  - identifier: schools
    attributes:
      - field: id
        generator: unique_integer
      - field: name
        generator: unique_string
        prefix: "school" # Optional argument for unique_string can help troubleshoot testing issues



sources:
  - source: raw_students
    description: This is the main source for student data
    identifier_map:
      - column: id
        identifier:
          name: students
          attribute: id
      - column: external_id
        identifier:
          name: students
          attribute: external_id

      # raw_students.school_id is a foreign key to lookup the school record
      # These identifiers need to be translated as well.
      - column: school_id
        identifier:
          name: schools
          attribute: id

  - source: raw_schools
    identifier_map:
      - column: id
        identifier:
          name: schools
          attribute: id
      - column: name
        identifier:
          name: schools
          attribute: name

  - source: raw_classes
    # We don't actually require a separate "classes" identifier.
    # The identifier doesn't even need to be unique within rows because
    # identifiers are only used to group records into classes.
    # This may not be realistic for data generated through standard MVC frameworks, but
    # is definitely a situation that can happen with some data sources.
    identifier_map:
      - column: student_id
        identifier:
          name: students
          attribute: id
    # source columns can be given defaults.  This can be useful when a source field shouldn't be
    # blank and needs some sensible default.
    defaults:
      - column: start_date
        value: '2002-06-01'


  # For some sources, it doesn't make sense to associate them with identifiers.
  # This is true when the source data does not change from one case to the next.
  # A perfect example of this is a list of dates, like this.
  - source: dim_date

targets:
  - target: student_classes
    description: Denormalized table with one record per student per class
    identifier_map:
      # The transformation will map the source field "external_id" to the target field "card_id"
      - column: card_id
        identifier:
          name: students
          attribute: external_id
      # Additionally, we've said that raw_schools.name is an identifier, which also appears on this target
      - column: school_name
        identifier:
          name: schools
          attribute: name

  - target: students_per_school
    identifier_map:
      - column: school_name
        identifier:
          name: schools
          attribute: name
