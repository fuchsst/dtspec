# This is a canonical dts test spec used for testing and low-level documentation.

# Genereal principles of a dts test spec:

# A dts test spec describes a set of test *cases*, which are used to define
# data sources and the expected results following some set of data transformations.
# Test *cases* can be grouped into *scenarios* that share some common set of data
# sources or data targets.

# A test spec is used to test the behavior of a single execution of a
# set of data transformations.  The data transformations may involve
# multiple steps with multiple data sources and targets.
# With dts, we define all of test source data and expectations up front.  If
# there are multiple test cases that use the same source data, then each test
# case will "stack" (concantenate) data for that source.

# After the test spec is defined, dts will respond will all of the stacked
# data sources.  The user will then inject those test data sources into whatever
# system they are using to run the data transformations.  They will then run
# the transformations and collect all of the resulting target data.

# The target data is then loaded back into the dts test api, and data assertions
# are run to ensure that the actual result data conforms to the
# expected data specified in the test spec.

# Factories will represent a collection of test data.
# Scenarios are a colletion of test cases that concern some shared topic.
#   - The code being tested is expected to run only 1 time for a scenario.
#   - One run could be associated with multiple scenarios, up to user to decide
# Cases will contain assertions about the results of a run
#  - they can also contain additional conditions about data defined in a scenario

# Identifiers are used to identify specific records and group them into test cases
# Identifiers are shared across all scenarios
# They

  # this is the "students" identifier.  It has 3 different attributes, any of which can be
  # used identify a record as a student.
